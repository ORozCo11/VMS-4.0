          <p className="auth-hero-subtitle">
            The Barangay Vehicle Management System (VMS) is a fleet management
            platform built for a barangay's emergency response vehicles —
            ambulances, fire trucks, and rescue boats. It answers two
            questions at any moment: is a vehicle ready to respond right now,
            and what is being done to keep it that way.
          </p>

          <div className="about-hero-body">
            <h3>What it covers</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Vehicle availability and physical condition, tracked independently</li>
              <li>A structured maintenance workflow — from a reported issue, through inspection and repair, to a verified return to service</li>
              <li>Preventive maintenance scheduling, including recurring service</li>
              <li>Fleet-wide readiness and reliability signals for planning ahead</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who it's for</h3>
            <p>
              Three roles share the workflow: an <strong>Admin</strong> who
              oversees the fleet, a <strong>Custodian</strong> who inspects
              vehicles and verifies repairs, and <strong>Maintenance
              Personnel</strong> who carry out the work — each accountable for
              their part of the process.
