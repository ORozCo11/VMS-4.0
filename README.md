# Barangay Vehicle Management System (VMS)

A web-based system for managing a barangay's fleet of **emergency response vehicles** (Ambulance, Fire Truck, Rescue Boat, and other units). The VMS keeps track of whether each vehicle is **ready to respond right now**, and manages the **maintenance lifecycle** that keeps it that way — from an issue being reported, through a structured repair workflow, to verified return-to-service.

It is built as a decoupled application: a **Laravel REST API** (`backend-api/`) and a **React single-page app** (`frontend-spa/`).

## Purpose & Scope

The system answers two operational questions for a barangay disaster/emergency unit:

- **"Can this vehicle be dispatched right now?"** — availability & readiness.
- **"What is being done to keep it serviceable, and by whom?"** — the maintenance lifecycle with accountability.

### In scope
- Fleet inventory and vehicle profiles
- Vehicle **availability** (dispatchable) and **condition** (physical state), tracked independently
- Issue reporting → maintenance tickets → repairs → verification → closure
- Preventive maintenance scheduling (including recurring)
- Emergency **readiness checks** and fleet **intelligence** (reliability, single-point-of-failure, failure patterns, decommission lifecycle)
- Location tracking of where vehicles are stationed (hubs)

### Out of scope (deliberate boundaries)
- **Operations / dispatch** (who drove where on a call)
- **Document compliance** (registration, insurance, permit expiry)
- **Mileage / odometer-based** servicing

These boundaries keep the system focused on **availability + maintenance**, which is what it is designed and defended to do.

## Roles & Access

The system has **three roles**. Each account has a **primary role** plus an optional set of **additional roles** (`users.roles`), so one person can wear several hats (e.g. a small barangay where one staffer is both Custodian and Maintenance Personnel). The sidebar a user sees is the **union** of every module across all their roles.

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Owns the fleet: registers vehicles, creates & closes tickets, assigns/reassigns mechanics, confirms repairs, manages users, decommissions vehicles, reads all analytics. |
| **Custodian** | The field inspector: reports issues, performs physical inspections, populates the repair checklist (sub-issues), and verifies completed repairs before they reach the Admin. |
| **Maintenance Personnel** (Mechanic) | Executes the actual repairs, logs work performed & parts used, and submits work orders for verification. |

Permission checks use role membership (not just the primary role), so multi-role users are correctly allowed to act under any hat they hold.

## The Maintenance Ticket Workflow

The core of the system is a **5-phase ticket workflow** built on a **Main Issue → Sub-Issue** model. A ticket (the "Main Issue") represents a problem on a vehicle; the individual root causes found during inspection become **sub-issues**, each with its own repair lifecycle.

### Ticket states
`Open → Active → Closed` (plus `Cancelled`)

### Sub-issue states
`Open → Under Repair → For Inspection → For Confirmation → Done` (plus `Deferred`)

### The five phases

1. **Phase 1 — Create (Admin).** Admin opens a ticket for a vehicle and assigns it to a Custodian. If the vehicle was already fixed for this same problem recently, the ticket is flagged as **recurring** (Nth time).

2. **Phase 2 — Inspect (Custodian).** The Custodian physically inspects the vehicle and records findings, turning the Main Issue into a list of concrete **sub-issues** (each with a maintenance category).

3. **Phase 3 — Dispatch & Repair (Admin → Mechanic).** Admin dispatches each sub-issue as a work order to a Maintenance Personnel. The mechanic logs repairs and parts used, then submits it **For Inspection**.
   - **Reassign:** while a work order is *Under Repair*, the Admin can hand it to a different mechanic (with a reason) so a repair is never frozen because one person is unavailable — both mechanics are notified.

4. **Phase 4 Tier 1 — Verify (Custodian).** The Custodian reviews the mechanic's work and runs a **functional test** — a domain checklist confirming the vehicle actually works (e.g. siren, lights) with an operator attestation. A failed test **bounces** the sub-issue back to the mechanic.

5. **Phase 4 Tier 2 — Confirm (Admin) → Phase 5 Close.** Admin issues the final confirmation verdict per sub-issue. Once every sub-issue is **resolved**, the Admin closes the ticket.

### Handling reality: deferral & decision-close
- **Defer a sub-issue:** something that can't be finished now (no budget, part on back-order) can be recorded as **Deferred** with a reason — and a **follow-up Issue Report is opened automatically** so it isn't forgotten.
- **Decision-close:** a ticket can be closed with unfinished work; the leftovers become Deferred, and the Admin must justify it **and** make an explicit **fit-for-service** call (is the vehicle safe to dispatch?). Closing a ticket never blindly returns a possibly-unsafe vehicle to service.
- **Aging:** open tickets are flagged once they pass 30 days.

### Archives
Closed tickets are locked in a permanent **Ticket Archive** audit log. An accidentally-*deleted* ticket that had real progress can be reopened from the archive.

---

## Feature Reference

### Fleet Inventory
- Register / edit / archive / restore vehicles, with photo upload.
- **Vehicle Types** (categories) with a **domain** (land / water) — water vehicles capture hull material (dropdown) and engine type.
- **Availability** (Available / Under Maintenance / Inactive / Decommissioned) vs **Condition** (physical state) tracked separately.
- Rich **vehicle profile page**: information, status & key dates, analytics, reliability, location map, documents/photos, and full maintenance record history.

### Issue Reporting
- Custodians report vehicle issues (severity-rated); Admin can convert an issue directly into a maintenance ticket.
- Deferred sub-issues auto-generate breadcrumb issue reports.

### Maintenance Records & Schedules
- **Maintenance Records:** log external/historical/third-party maintenance and costs without running the full ticket workflow. Verify/confirm flow supported.
- **Maintenance Schedules:** plan preventive maintenance.
  - **Recurring PM:** a schedule can repeat (Monthly / Quarterly / Every 6 months / Yearly).
  - **Complete & close the loop:** marking a schedule "Done" in one action records the proof-of-work maintenance record **and** auto-creates the next occurrence at *completed date + interval* if it recurs.

### Condition Monitoring
- Records and filters vehicle condition checks over time (by category, condition, and date range).

### Vehicle Location
- **Leaflet map** of the barangay (Paknaan) showing **hubs** and how many vehicles are stationed at each.
- **Map / Satellite** basemap toggle (Esri World Imagery, no API key) — defaults to **Satellite**.
- Highlighted **Paknaan boundary** (high-visibility line), hub management (Admin can add/pin/remove hubs), focus-on-vehicle, fullscreen, and **Download Map** (PNG snapshot).
- A tabular **Location Record** with history.

### Vehicle History
- Automatic, paginated activity timeline across location, issue, condition, and maintenance events (10 / 20 / 40 / 50 per page, searchable).

### Notifications
- In-app notifications for workflow handoffs (assignments, reassignments, verifications), with read/read-all/delete.

### Reports
- Report catalog with a generator and printable preview (browser print), plus **CSV export** on Vehicles and Schedules.

### Users & Logs
- User management (create, edit, activate/deactivate) with multi-role support.
- Read-only **accountability logs** of user actions (paginated).

### UI/UX
- Light/dark theme support throughout.
- Calm, consistent card design; paginated data tables; dismissible per-module hints; labeled primary actions.

## Fleet Intelligence & Dashboard

The dashboard surfaces the operational and analytical signals that make this more than a CRUD app:

- **Emergency readiness & coverage** — how many units of each type are ready to respond.
- **Response-readiness checks** — a "ready to respond" checklist per vehicle, with a freshness window (a readiness check goes stale after 24h; "never checked" is flagged).
- **Availability forecast** — expected return-to-service dates.
- **Preventive-maintenance watch** — services coming due.
- **Reliability** — failure counts (6-/12-month), average days out of service, and lifetime repair spend; chronic/repeat-failure units flagged.
- **Single point of failure** — vehicle types with only one working unit.
- **Fleet-wide failure patterns** — recurring failure categories across the fleet.
- **Decommission lifecycle** — retire a vehicle that is no longer worth keeping, with a reason.

---

## Data Model

Key Eloquent models (`backend-api/app/Models/`):

| Model | Purpose |

## Security

- **Token auth:** Laravel Sanctum bearer tokens; the SPA attaches the token via an axios interceptor.
- **Rate limiting:** login and password-change endpoints are throttled (`throttle:10,1`) to blunt brute-forcing.
- **Input sanitization** (`SanitizeInput` middleware): strips NULL/control characters and guards against invalid UTF-8 — **non-destructive** (does not strip HTML, because the correct XSS defense is output-encoding, not input mangling).
- **Security headers** (`SecurityHeaders` middleware): `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, a strict `Content-Security-Policy`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and removal of `X-Powered-By`/`Server`.
- **XSS:** React auto-escapes output; no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; user-supplied URLs are protocol-checked.
- **SQL injection:** all queries are parameterized (Eloquent / bound placeholders).
- **Authorization:** every controller action enforces role membership; ownership checks (e.g. only the assigned Custodian/Mechanic can add a sub-issue) are by ID, not just role label.

> **Dev-only impersonation:** a fast role-switching tool exists for local testing. It is **double-gated** (server returns 404 unless `APP_ENV` is `local`/`testing`, and the UI is compiled out of production builds). **It is slated for removal before production.**

---

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.3+ and Composer
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### 1. Backend (`backend-api/`)
```bash
cd backend-api
composer install
cp .env.example .env          # then edit as needed
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed     # creates SQLite DB + seeds accounts & mock data
```

By default the app uses **SQLite** (`DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`). Create the file if it doesn't exist:
```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Vehicle photos/attachments use **Supabase Storage** (S3-compatible) — set the `SUPABASE_*` values in `.env`, or switch `FILESYSTEM_DISK=local` for local file storage during development.

### 2. Frontend (`frontend-spa/`)
```bash
cd frontend-spa
npm install
```
The API base URL defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api`. To point elsewhere, create `frontend-spa/.env`:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001/api
```

### Seeded accounts
| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@barangay.gov` | `admin123` |
| Custodian | `custodian@barangay.gov` | `custodian123` |
| Maintenance Personnel | `maintenance@barangay.gov` | `maintenance123` |

> ⚠️ These are **development** credentials — change them before any real deployment.

---

## Running the App

**Backend** (serve on port 8001 to match the frontend's default API URL):
```bash
cd backend-api
php artisan serve --port=8001
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend-spa
npm run dev        # Vite dev server (default http://localhost:5173)
```

Then open the SPA and sign in with a seeded account.

For a production build of the SPA:
```bash
npm run build      # outputs to frontend-spa/dist/
```

---

## Testing

Feature tests live in `backend-api/tests/Feature/`:

| Suite | Covers |
|---|---|
| `TicketWorkflowTest` | The full 5-phase ticket lifecycle, deferral, reassign, functional test, decision-close. |
| `FleetIntelligenceTest` | Readiness, reliability, single-point-of-failure, failure patterns, decommission. |
| `ScheduleCompletionTest` | Recurring PM + schedule/record close-the-loop. |
| `MultiRoleTest` | Multi-role account permissions. |
| `VehicleValidationTest` | Vehicle field validation. |
| `ImpersonationTest` | Dev-only impersonation gating. |
| `SmokeTest` / `ExampleTest` | Baseline. |

Run the whole suite:
```bash
cd backend-api
php artisan test
```

Verify the frontend builds:
```bash
cd frontend-spa
npm run build
```

---

## Deployment

Planned deployment topology (deferred):
- **Frontend:** Vercel (Vite static build).
- **Backend:** Render (Docker; PHP 8.4 image).
- **Database:** managed **Postgres** (Supabase), seeded fresh via the seeders.
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for photos/attachments.

Set production env values (`APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, database credentials, `SUPABASE_*`, and the SPA's `VITE_API_BASE_URL`) accordingly. Remember to **remove the dev-only impersonation feature** before going live.
