 * barangay_id — a Super Admin never does, so those scopes silently no-op
 * and would otherwise leak every barangay's full fleet data through the
 * ordinary /vehicles, /tickets, etc. endpoints. Rather than adding a
 * role check to dozens of individual controller methods, this is an
 * allowlist: a Super Admin may only reach /superadmin/*, /impersonate/*,
